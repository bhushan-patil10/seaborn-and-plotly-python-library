# 📊 Data Visualization with Seaborn & Plotly

This project explores **Seaborn** and **Plotly**, two of the most powerful Python libraries for data visualization. It includes practical examples of creating compelling and interactive plots using real-world datasets.

## 🌈 Seaborn

**Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It works seamlessly with Pandas data structures and is widely used in exploratory data analysis.

### 🔹 Key Features of Seaborn

- Beautiful default themes
- Built-in support for Pandas
- Statistical plots (distribution, categorical, regression)
- Automatic aggregation and confidence intervals
- Palette and style customization

### 🧰 Common Seaborn Methods Used

- `sns.barplot()` – for categorical bar plots
- `sns.lineplot()` – for time-series or trend analysis
- `sns.displot()` - to create distribution plots across a Facet Grid based on col and row variables
- `sns.ecdfplot()` - Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) plot, which shows the proportion of data points less than or equal to a given value — useful 
                     for visualizing data distributions.
- `distribution plot` -combining histograms and optionally KDE curves to show the frequency and spread of data points.
- - `sns.histplot()` – for histogram plotting
- `sns.kdeplot()`- useful for understanding the probability density of continuous variables.
- `sns.scatterplot()` – for point data visualization
- `sns.set_theme()` – to apply visual themes

## ⚡ Plotly

**Plotly** is a graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Plotly Express (a high-level API in Plotly) makes it easy to create a wide variety of plots with just a few lines of code.

### 🔹 Key Features of Plotly

- Interactive and web-based visualizations
- Intuitive Plotly Express API
- Wide range of chart types: scatter, line, bar, area



### 🧰 Common Plotly Methods Used

- `px.scatter()` – for scatter and bubble plots
- `px.line()` – to show trends over time
- `px.bar()` – for bar charts
- `px.histogram()` – for histograms
- `px.area()` – for area 
- `px.data.gapminder()` – to load built-in sample datasets
